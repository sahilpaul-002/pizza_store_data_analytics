Sales Analysis Project | SQL & Excel
Description:
Conducted a sales analysis for a pizza store to uncover insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. The project utilized SQL for data extraction and validation, and Excel for cleaning, analysis, and visualization to support data-driven decision-making.

Process:
Data Cleaning in Excel: Cleaned and pre-processed raw sales data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Data Extraction to SQL: Extracted the cleaned data from Excel into SQL for more efficient querying and deeper analysis, leveraging SQLâ€™s capabilities to handle large datasets.
Data Validation in SQL: Validated data integrity by writing and executing SQL queries to check for inconsistencies or anomalies, documenting each query and its response for future reference and auditing.
Dynamic Dashboard in Excel: Created a dynamic dashboard using Excel, incorporating pivot tables, charts, and interactive features to visualize sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior for easy consumption by stakeholders.
